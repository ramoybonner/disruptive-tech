									<li> <b> Automoblies </b>  were first used for short distance transport in residential areas, where they replaced streetcars (rail) and industrial tracks. When roads started to expand, longer distance transports were moved to road traffic and a lot of railways went out of use. Railways are still used in some countries for passenger transport in areas with high road traffic and for industrial purposes where it's more feasible. </li><br>
									<li> <b> Private Jets </b> completely replaced the supersonic airliners in the early 2000’s. Supersonic jets were designed to travel faster than the speed of sound and were used extensively for commercial traffic. It had numerous drawbacks from the disturbingly loud noise it made at high speeds (sonic boom) to its cost and safety. The loss of speed in this market was circumvented by flexibility and more direct routing in the private jets. </li> <br>
									<li> <b> High speed rail </b> has taken over almost every market it has been introduced, mostly those with travel times of at most 2 hours. The air services in this competition have seen their profits drop and thus moved their attention to longer travel distances.  </li>
								</ul>
								
							<p><b> One for the Future: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> High-speed travel technology has already taken the first step towards reality with the first test involving the <b>Hyperloop</b> One prototype propulsion system. Elon Musk, founder of the <b>Hyperloop</b>, intends to make this a reality before 2020, and has recently closed an $80 million funding round that includes investment from several other companies. When this emerging technology gets developed and implemented on a mass scale, it will solve many complex long distance issues. High-speed travel could also relieve over-crowded cities by decreasing the need for urbanisation. </li>

								<p><b> One Career that will become obsolete: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> While traditional <b> taxi drivers </b> may be feeling the pinch from the likes of Uber and Lyft, drivers of all three will see their jobs dry up as autonomous vehicles hit the road. And it’s the ride-share companies who can’t wait to rush their drivers out of the car. As Uber’s CEO has said, its service would be a lot more inexpensive and its profits much greater if you weren’t “paying for that other dude in the car.” In the next 10 years, cities across the world will have fleets of self-driving taxis. Uber is testing such vehicles and Singapore is the first country to already put up to a dozen on the roads. </li>

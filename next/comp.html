							<p><b> Previous Disruptive Technologies: </b>
							
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> Before the rise of <b>cloud computing</b>, businesses were responsible for all aspects of their networking hardware and maintenance, regardless of how much they were using these resources at any given time. They were also without options when their servers were maxed out. <b>Cloud computing</b> companies like Amazon Web Services offered an alternative: rent storage space and processing power on their massive servers as needed. When clients use a provider’s servers, they’re charged. As soon as they stop, charges stop. This allowed companies of all sizes to access cost-effective computing and storage solutions and greatly lowered the cost of entry for tech startups. It’s proven so game-changing that even competitors like Netflix rely on AWS to keep their streaming services up and running. And for individuals as well, distributed cloud storage from services like Dropbox and Google Drive allow users to store files of all kinds and sizes on remote servers and access them at any time. </li><br>
									<li> Before the <b> Microprocessor </b> an entire room was necessary to house one computer no more powerful than today's typical laptop. We live in a different era now thanks to the microprocessor (or CPU), that tiny beating heart of your desktop or laptop that just keeps getting smaller at the same time its gets more powerful. As a result it has reshapped the market and has completely replaced other computers. </li> <br>
									<li> The <b> Windows operating system </b> provided a combination of affordability and a user-friendly interface was instrumental in the rapid development of the personal computing industry in the 1990s. Personal computing disrupted the television industry, as well as a great number of other activities. </li>
								</ul>
		
							<p><b> One for the Future: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> is exhibited by computers and other machines. It’s a flexible agent that perceives its environment and takes the necessary action required for the success of that particular phenomenon. Artificial intelligence is used when machines copy the cognitive functions of the human brain in learning and solving problems. As machines become increasingly capable, other facilities are removed from the definition. Although this area has a long history, professionals in the field are getting ever closer to achieving artificial intelligence. </li>

							<p><b> One Career that will become obsolete: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> It’s likely that many of the remaining human-based teller and representative banking jobs will be finished off by <b> Artificial Intelligence </b>. AI won’t just be able to conduct cash transactions, it will be able to open accounts and process loans at a fraction of the cost and time it takes for human employees. “The ATM of tomorrow is going to replace the teller,” Andy Mattes, CEO of financial software company Diebold told the network. “It can do approximately 90% of what the human being can do, and it’s going to be your branch in a box.” </li>

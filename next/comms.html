							<p><b> Previous Disruptive Technologies: </b></p>
							
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> <b> Emails </b> transformed the way we communicate, largely displacing letter-writing and disrupting the postal and greeting card industries. </li><br>
									<li> <b> Cell phones </b> made it possible for people to call us anywhere and disrupted the telecom industry. </li><br>
									<li> <b> Social networking </b> has had a major impact on the way we communicate and -- especially for personal use -- has disrupted telephone, email, instant messaging and event planning.  </li>
								</ul>
								
								<p><b> One for the Future: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> The <b>5G</b> mobile cellular communications system, which should be released later in 2020, will provide a far higher level of performance than the previous generations of mobile communications systems(4G, 3G, 2G, 1G). It has been driven by the need to provide ubiquitous connectivity for applications as diverse as automotive communications, remote control with haptic style feedback, huge video downloads, as well as the very low data rate applications like remote sensors and what is being termed the IoT, Internet of Things. </li>

								<p><b> One Career that will become obsolete: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> <B>Journalism</b> would not a problem for Artificial Inteligence. In 2014, the Associated Press began to use intelligent software to write quarterly earnings reports. Up to 3,000 reports are being written by AI every quarter, the Verge reported. It’s entirely feasible that content sites of the future could exist without any human writers at all. </li>

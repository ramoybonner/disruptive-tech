							<p><b> Previous Disruptive Technologies: </b></p>
							
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> Few innovations have so disrupted the music industry like the advent of digital music files, specifically the <b>MP3</b>. These compact files could fit easily on CDs and hard drives as data, allowing enterprising early adopters to cram more music on older storage media and opened the way for compact <b>MP3</b> players. It also opened the way for widespread and unstoppable file sharing and music theft, via early services like Napster and Kazaa and later via torrenting systems. More above-board services that use <b>MP3</b> technology include iTunes, direct online music sales, and current streaming options like Spotify and SoundCloud </li><br>
									<li> Since the emergence of <b> video streaming </b>, licensing deals between film studios and streaming providers has become frequent. Its development has shifted the market and the need for people to get physical rentals at a different store is now over. Netflix is a dominant company in this market.  </li><br>
									<li> <b> Downloadable media </b> filled the music industry with illegal peer-to-peer file sharing technologies and companies like iTunes Store and Amazon.com came along to make profits from the developing tech. This damaged the market for high-cost, physical recordings like records, tapes and CDs. </li>
								</ul>
								
								<p><b> One for the Future: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> <b> Virtual Reality </b> already exists on a commercial level. However, it may become even more advanced by being developed to help people enhance their memories or even mental wellbeing. There will be lots of benefits coming from Virtual Reality. Companies such as Void and Virtalis are already helping people experience new dimensions and things without limits. </li>
								</ul>

								<p><b> One Career that will become obsolete: </b></p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li> It’s possible that we could see <b> actors </b> looking as young in movies as they did when they first debuted on the big screen. Recently, Hollywood has taken a liking to advanced Computer Generated Imagery(CGI) techniques that allow even deceased <b> actors </b> to be resurrected from the dead–the most notable example being Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin CGI resurrection in Rogue One: a Star Wars Story. In the same 2016 movie, Carrie Fisher also appeared as the 21-year-old Princess Leia from the 1977 Star Wars film. It’s possible that if both studios and audiences embrace the CGI resurrection technology, there will be fewer jobs for new potential movie stars in the future as the same beloved stars of today (and yesterday) could keep staring and “acting” in big blockbusters for decades to come. </li>
